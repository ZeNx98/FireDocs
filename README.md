### Why FireDocs?
FireDocs is built for people who want a dedicated space for reading without the clutter of a web browser. It’s lightweight, privacy-focused, and stays out of your way.

#### **Better than a Browser (PDF.js Improvements):**
- **Lightweight** : Provides a native app feel with optimized performance.
- **Native Experience** : No browser tabs, address bars, or distractions.
- **Modern UI** : Optimized for focus, updated UI and styles.
- **De-Cluttered Interface** : Removed trash features and unneeded buttons from the standard PDF.js for a more comfortable reading experience.
- **Smarter Zoom & Rendering** : Improved zoom logic and more stable page rendering.
- **Better Annotations** : A refined highlighting and drawing experience, including smarter tool selection and restricted ink selection to prevent accidental edits.
- **Persistent Recents** : Standard PDF.js doesn't remember your files. FireDocs keeps your last 6 documents ready on the homepage.
